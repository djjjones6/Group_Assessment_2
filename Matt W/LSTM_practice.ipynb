    "LSTM is an RNN that can capture the pattern in sequential data. The benefit is that it can learn and remember for long sequences. In keras this is referred to as setting the stateful argument as true in the lstm layer \n",
    "Lstm includes three important gates: input gate, forget gate and the output gate. The interactive operation among these three gates makes LSTM have the sufficient ability to solve the problem of long-term dependencies\n",
    "which general RNNs cannot learn. \"The learning speed of the previous hidden layers is slower than the deeper\n",

    "Hence, LSTM is commonly used for solving applications related to time serial issues. \""
